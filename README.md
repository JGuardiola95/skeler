# Node.js API Project Skeleton

This is a repository that provides a skeleton for a nodeJS API.

I got tired of always redoing the same stuff for my personal projects, so I decided to create this super opinionated skeleton.

It's configured with Express, TypeScript, ESLint, Prettier, and other tools to streamline the development process.

I will continually add new stuff. Hope if helps someone! :)

## Features

- **Express.js**: Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js.
- **TypeScript**: Adds static typing to JavaScript, enhancing code quality and understandability.
- **Prisma**: Next-generation ORM for Node.js and TypeScript, making database access easy and type-safe.
- **ESLint**: Linting utility for JavaScript and TypeScript, ensuring code quality and consistency.
- **Prettier**: An opinionated code formatter, enforcing a consistent style across your codebase.
- **.env**: Loads environment variables from a `.env` file into `process.env`, managing configuration separately from code. [Read more](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v20.6.0)
- **Path Aliases**: Custom path aliases using `module-alias` and `typescript` for cleaner and more manageable import paths.
- **Docker**: Containerize the application for easy deployment and scalable production runs.
